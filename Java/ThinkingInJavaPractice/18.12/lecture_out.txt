Line 0:Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Line 1:Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 
Line 2:We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
Line 3: We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 
Line 4:It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
